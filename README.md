## Getting Started

### Installation

Retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL
<br>
<p> &nbsp <b> git clone https://github.com/asya-code/your_line_says.git </b> </p>

You’d then create a virtual environment:

<p> &nbsp <b> virtualenv env </b> </p>

Next, you’d activate that environment:
<br>

<p> &nbsp <b> source env/bin/activate </b> </p>

Finally, you’d use pip3 to install all of the requirements:
<br>

<p> &nbsp <b> (env) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt </b> </p>
The -r option lets you supply a text file in the format pip3 freeze produces. This command should install all of the listed libraries.

To confirm that the correct packages are installed, you’d just run:
<br>

<p> &nbsp <b> pip3 freeze </b> </p>

### Launch your server

Once you’ve set up your virtual environment, activated it, and installed Flask, you should just be able to type:
<br>
<p> &nbsp <b> python3 server.py </b> </p>
